# 162_Fantasy_Game
Text interface fantasy game in C++ utilizing basic data structures and object oriented programming principles.

This program simulates a D&D style fantasy game where two teams of creatures are created, each in order into a linked list. Creatures battle to the'death' at which time the dying creature is added to the loser pile and the winner is added to the back of the line for additional combat. After one team has no more surviving members, the tournament ceases. A winning team is determined by total number of points (additional bonus points for surviving members) and the top three individual finishers regardless of team are announced.
